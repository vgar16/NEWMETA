comp018,GUSTAVO_NAVARRE.jpeg,,Gustavo Navarre,image/jpeg,"A pioneer among the musicians of his generation, Navarre is one of the most influential Bolivian composers of his time. Born in La Paz in 1931, he began his formal musical education at an early age, and in 1947 he became a student of Egon-Carl Schif. The following year he entered the National Conservatory of Music of La Paz, to continue his piano studies under the tutelage of Alicia Eguino de Justiniano and Mario Estensoro. While at the conservatory he studied music theory with Teófilo Molina, and harmony and counterpoint with Erich Eisner.

In 1968, he participated in a competition in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was awarded a scholarship to study music at the Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris, France. During this period, he studied orchestration, composition, and musical analysis with world-renowned composers such as Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) and Marcel Mihalovici (1898-1985).

Director of the National Conservatory of Music in 1970. Navarre has received many recognitions including several national awards including, the Ministry of Education Award, and the prestigious Luz Mila Patiño Award. Navarre died in La Paz in 2006.
    Gustavo Navarre was a prolific composer, unfortunately most of his work was lost in a fire in the 1990’s. Items lost include original, plain copies, manuscripts, and a catalog of his works. It is only through his colleagues, fellow musicians, family, and friends accounts of his prolific production are known. Fellow composer, Atiliano Auza describes his composition style as neo-romantic, but with a local influence. Musicologists Suzanne Spicer Tiemstra and Gerard Béhague describe his style as a combination of neo-romanticism with Bolivian elements and nationalism.The musicologist Leslie Bethell affirms that Navarre had ""created a neo-romantic language sometimes combined with features of Bolivian folk music.” Navarre work included 
written vocal works, sonatas, piano trios, string quartets, and piano quintets, as well as larger orchestral compositions, including at least two symphonies. 
	The news of this loss was devastating not only for the Navarre family but also for Bolivia's musical heritage. However, to the surprise of many, some of Navarre's compositions have emerged recently. Photocopies of a Sonata for violin and piano, a string quartet, a short Elegy for violin and piano, and a symphony in two movements have been found in private collections and the library of the National Symphony Orchestra in La Paz. In June 2012, during a concert trip to Bolivia, researcher Javier Pinell and co-researcher Sergio Ruiz became aware of these results and the idea of ​​compiling these manuscripts, their study, public presentation, and recording",n/a,,1931,,,Gustavo Navarre,"La Paz, Bolivia",-16.489689,-68.119293,,,,,,,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
